# Issue/Merge request templates

In this repository are located default issue and merge request templates to
prevent situations when we should create same templates for every repository.

## Preparation

If you are using `/label` tag in your issue template you should have label
already exist in project/group.

**Why only GitLab issue template?**

Most of the work we do- happens in GitLab, so currently this repository 
contains only GitLab issue template
